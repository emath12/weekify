# Weekify

Welcome to Weekify. Weekify allows you to add tasks dynamically to a calandar using the form at the bottom of its page. The tasks appear, Google Calender-esch, on the appropiate day of the week and row of time. A reset button allows you to erase what is currently displayed. 

In making this application, I learned the intracies of React State design principles, how to maintain a remote codebase that others contribuite to, and new techniques in leveraging the flexibility of JavaScript. Specifically, I contributed the functionality that allows tasks to be added to the page from the form along with the button that clears it.
